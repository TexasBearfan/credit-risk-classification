Overview:
    This model and exercise it built in order to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers
    and there for classify and predict loans that would have a benefical effect on the lender.
Results:
    Accuracy:72.96%
    Loss:56.17%
    Precision: 71.89%
    Recall:80.30%
Summary:
    The results are a mixed bag. The acuuracy appears to be high however the loss is beyond acceptable levels and for a
    financial institution to hand out loans based upon this model it woudl not be benefical in the long term. The
    Model would pick mostly winners but the error in it would either entirely negate or at the very least significantly
    damage the profits. I do not recommend using this model.
